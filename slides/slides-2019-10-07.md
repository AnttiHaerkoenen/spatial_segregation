# Research Problem

- how segregated population of Vyborg was?
- orthodox vs lutherans

# Data & Methods

# Data

- population & tax registers
- cadastral maps
- handwritten digit recognition using CV & ML

# Methods

- spatial segregation analysis
- traditional aspatial indices (e.g. Index of dissimilarity) suffer from MAUP

# Kernel density estimation

- smoothing of population surfaces using kernel functions
- grid represents continuous distribution of population in town space

# Spatial segregation index S

- $S = 1 - \frac{V_{\cap}}{V_{\cup}}$
- $$V_{\cap} = \sum_{n=0}^N{min(\tilde p_{hn}, \tilde p_{gn})}$$
- $$V_{\cup} = \sum_{n=0}^N{max(\tilde p_{hn}, \tilde p_{gn})}$$

# Results

# Segregation

- S seems to first decrease, then increase
- concentrations of Orthodox population change significantly

# Conclusion

- integration in peaceful times 
- ... followed by segregation and violence during political crisis

# What next

- more data needed
- software for automatic reading of sources coming along
